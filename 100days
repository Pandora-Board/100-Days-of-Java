Hello everyone !!
Excited to announce that I'm starting a 100 days coding challenge today! Over the next 100 days, I'll be committing to coding for at least an hour every day to improve my skills and work towards my coding goals. I'll be sharing my progress and what I'm learning along the way, and I welcome any tips and encouragement from my network. Let's do this! ðŸ’»ðŸš€ #100DaysOfCode #CodingChallenge #ProgrammingGoals #LearnToCode
